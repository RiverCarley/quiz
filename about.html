        How This Site Works
    </h3>
    <p>
        Answer the three questions by choosing one of the three options on the quiz page. After choosing your options, a book will appear as a suggestion, and you can click the links for Goodreads and Amazon at the bottom of the page to go to the respective site’s page for the book suggested. If you click the link before taking the quiz, it will take you to the respective site’s home page.

    <h3>
        Why I Read
    </h3>
    <p>
        I have struggled with spelling my whole life and a few years ago, I underwent an educational assessment. It brought to light that I have a learning disability in spelling due to poor visual memory. Since then, I have been trying to read more because everyone always told me that reading is the best way to improve one’s spelling. I have gotten into a habit of reading for at least an hour a day and I read on average more than 500 pages a week now. Last year was my high score for most books read in a year but I’m set to beat it this year if I keep up the current pace.

    <h3>
        How I Choose Books
    </h3>
    <p>
        I have read all the books in the quiz, most of them in 2023. I read 35 books last year and the quiz involves only 27, but I read a lot of series and only included the first book from each series in the quiz. I had to borrow some books from my high school curriculum and from the previous year’s reading to fill out the list. I normally choose a book to read by looking up award-winning and famous books, but I also read a few books suggested by friends and family. A lot of the suggested books turn out to be some of my favourites and that’s what inspired this quiz. Suggestions can lead to some great new book discoveries    </br>
